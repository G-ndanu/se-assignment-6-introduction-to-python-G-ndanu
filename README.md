2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

   Installing Python on Windows 11
   1. Download Python Installer
   Go to the official Python website: python.org
   Navigate to the Downloads section and click on "Download Python ..." (...indicates version installed).
   Ensure to download the Windows installer (.exe file).

   2. Run the Installer
   Once the installer is downloaded, double-click the .exe file to launch the Python installer.

   3. Configure Python Installation
   In the installer window, select "Add Python ... to PATH" option. This ensures Python is added to your system PATH, allowing you to run Python from the command line easily (...indicates version installed).
   Click on "Install Now" to start the installation. Python will be installed with default settings.

   4. Complete the Installation
   Wait for the installation process to complete which may take a few minutes.

   5. Verify Python Installation
   Open the Command Prompt by typing cmd in the Windows search bar and selecting Command Prompt.
   Type python --version and press Enter. This command will display the installed Python version. If Python is installed correctly, you'll see something like Python ... (...indicates version installed)

   Setting Up a Virtual Environment
   1. Install virtualenv
   Open Command Prompt.
   Install virtualenv globally by typing: pip install virtualenv

   2. Create a Virtual Environment
   Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment using Command Prompt.
   Create a new virtual environment by typing: python -m venv myenv (myenv is the preferred name for the virtual environment)

   3. Activate the Virtual Environment
   Activate the virtual environment by navigating to the Scripts directory inside your virtual environment folder and running:
   On Command Prompt type: myenv\Scripts\activate
   You will see (myenv) before the Command Prompt path, indicating the virtual environment is active.

   4. Deactivate the Virtual Environment
   To deactivate the virtual environment, type: deactivate
   This will return you to the global Python environment.


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   # Python program to print "Hello, World!"
   print("Hello, World!")

   Basic syntax elements used
   1. Function Call
   print() is a function call. Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword and can be called with arguments inside parentheses ().
   
   2. String Literal
   "Hello, World!" is a string literal in Python. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes (' or "). Python treats single and double quotes the same for string literals.
   

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   Basic data types in Python
   1. Integer (int)
   Represents whole numbers, positive or negative, without any decimal point.
   Example: x = 10
   
   2. Float (float)
   Represents numbers with a decimal point or in exponential form using e or E.
   Example: y = 3.14
   
   3. String (str)
   Represents sequences of characters enclosed within single quotes (') or double quotes (").
   Example: name = "Alice"
   
   4. Boolean (bool)
   Represents the truth values True or False.
   Example: is_student = True
   
   5. List (list)
   Represents an ordered collection of items, which can be of different types.
   Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   
   6. Tuple (tuple)
   Similar to lists, but tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).
   Example: coordinates = (10, 20)
   
   7. Dictionary (dict)
   Represents a collection of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces {}.
   Example: person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}

   Script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types
   # Define variables of different data types
   x = 10          # integer
   y = 3.14        # float
   name = "Alice"  # string
   is_student = True  # boolean
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # list
   coordinates = (10, 20)     # tuple
   person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}  # dictionary
   
   # Print the values and types of variables
   print("x:", x, "Type:", type(x))
   print("y:", y, "Type:", type(y))
   print("name:", name, "Type:", type(name))
   print("is_student:", is_student, "Type:", type(is_student))
   print("numbers:", numbers, "Type:", type(numbers))
   print("coordinates:", coordinates, "Type:", type(coordinates))
   print("person:", person, "Type:", type(person))


5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   Use of conditional statements and loops in Python
   - Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition evaluates to True or False.
   - Loops in Python allow you to iterate over a sequence of elements (such as lists, tuples, or strings) or execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.

   Examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop
   # Example of an if-else statement
   age = 20
   
   if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
   else:
    print("You are a minor.")

   # Example of a for loop
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   for num in numbers:
    print(num)


6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They encapsulate logic and can accept inputs (arguments), perform operations and optionally return a result.

   They are useful for: 
   1. Modularization: Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.
   2. Reusability: Using the same code block multiple times without rewriting it.
   3. Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and focusing on the interface.
   4. Organization: Structuring code for better readability and maintenance.

   A Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum and an example of how to call this function
   def sum_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

    # Example of calling the function
    result = sum_numbers(10, 5)
    print("Sum:", result)


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   Differences between lists and dictionaries in Python
   1. Lists maintain the order of elements based on their indices (numbers[0] accesses the first element), whereas dictionaries store data as key-value pairs and do not guarantee the order of items (person['age'] accesses the age value but not necessarily in the order they were added).
   2. Lists are ideal for ordered collections where the sequence of elements matters, allowing sequential access and modification (numbers.append(6) adds 6 to the end), while dictionaries optimize retrieval by keys, suitable for associative arrays requiring fast lookup and modification by key (person['phone'] = '123-456-7890' adds a phone number associated with the key 'phone').
   3. Lists use square brackets [] to define their structure (numbers = [1, 2, 3]), whereas dictionaries use curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons (person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}).

   Script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   person = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
   }

   print("Initial list of numbers:", numbers)
   print("Initial dictionary:", person)

   numbers.append(6)       # Adding an element to the list
   numbers.remove(3)       # Removing an element from the list
   numbers[0] = 10         # Modifying an element in the list

   print("\nUpdated list of numbers:", numbers)
   print("Updated dictionary:", person)


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   Exception handling in Python allows you to manage and respond to errors that occur during program execution. It ensures that your program can handle unexpected situations gracefully without crashing.

   Example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   try:
      num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
      num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
    
      result = num1 / num2  # Potential division by zero error
    
      print(f"Result of division: {result}")
    
   except ValueError:
      print("Error: Please enter a valid integer.")

  except ZeroDivisionError:
      print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")

  finally:
      print("Execution complete. Closing resources if necessary.")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   In Python, modules and packages are fundamental concepts used for organizing and reusing code.
   1. Module
   A module in Python is a single file containing Python definitions, statements, and functions. It serves as a way to structure Python code and logically group related code together.
   Modules can define functions, classes and variables and can also include runnable code.
   You can create your own modules to encapsulate reusable components of your program, making your code more organized and easier to maintain.

   To use a module in your Python script, you need to import it using the import statement.
   Once imported, you can access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module using dot notation (module_name.item_name).

   Example using the `math` module:
   import math

   # Using math module functions
   print("Value of pi:", math.pi)
   print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))
   print("Cosine of pi:", math.cos(math.pi))

   2.Package
   A package in Python is a way to structure Python’s module namespace by using "dotted module names". It consists of multiple modules that are grouped together.
   Packages are directories containing Python modules and an __init__.py file (which can be empty) that indicates the directory is a Python package.
   Packages help organize large projects with many modules, providing a hierarchical structure and preventing naming conflicts.


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    Reading from a File
    To read from a file in Python:
    1. Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('r' for reading).
    2. Read from the File: Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read the file content.
    3. Close the File: Use the close() method to close the file after reading.

   # Specify the file path
   file_path = 'example.txt'

   try:
      # Open the file in read mode
      with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
          # Read and print the entire content of the file
          content = file.read()
          print("File content:")
          print(content)

   except FileNotFoundError:
      print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")

   except IOError:
      print(f"Error: Unable to read the file '{file_path}'.")

   except Exception as e:
      print(f"Error: {e}")


   Writing to a File
   To write to a file in Python:
   1. Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('w' for writing). If the file doesn't exist, it will be created. Use 'a' mode to append to an existing file.
   2. Write to the File: Use the write() method to write data to the file.
   3. Close the File: Use the close() method to close the file after writing.

   # Specify the file path
   file_path = 'output.txt'

   # List of strings to write to the file
   lines = [
       "Hello, World!",
       "This is line 2.",
       "And this is line 3."
   ]

   try:
       # Open the file in write mode
       with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
          # Write each line from the list to the file
           for line in lines:
               file.write(line + '\n')

       print(f"Successfully wrote {len(lines)} lines to '{file_path}'.")

   except IOError:
       print(f"Error: Unable to write to the file '{file_path}'.")

   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error: {e}")
